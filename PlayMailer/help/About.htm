<body><h1>About</h1>PlayMailer is an automated play-by-email system for Windows 8/7/Vista/XP. Think of it as a multiplayer networking add-on for old<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turn-based</span>
strategy games, or&nbsp;turn-based games that don't possess their
own&nbsp;networking functionality. PlayMailer integrates&nbsp;with a
supported game (or with a DOS emulator running a game) and simplifies
the process of sending a game's save file&nbsp;to other players via
email. It also simplifies the process of loading and saving games and
setting up&nbsp;new games. PlayMailer allows you to keep track of
multiple play-by-email sessions at once through its easy to
use&nbsp;graphical interface. PlayMailer provides full player-list
management and other features such as integrated in-game chat. <br><br>Play-by-email
is great for busy people who want to play a leisurely&nbsp;game with
friends over several days or longer, without requiring them to
continuously monitor their game window. With PlayMailer you can close
your game window (or shutdown your computer) following your turn
and&nbsp;continue to be alerted the next time its your turn.<br><br>PlayMailer currently supports 5 games:<br><ul><li>Chess Titans &nbsp;(Windows Vista/Windows 7 Chess Program)</li><li>Master of Orion II &nbsp;(MicroProse 1996)</li><li>Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire &nbsp;(Firaxis Games 2000)</li><li>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri &nbsp;(Firaxis Games 1999)</li><li>Warlords &nbsp;(SSG 1990)</li></ul>If
there's a particular turn-based strategy that you'd like to see
supported by PlayMailer, you can email me with a request at <a href="mailto:raj@playmailer.net">raj@playmailer.net</a> and eventually I'll get around to it.&nbsp;I would
prefer if the game met&nbsp;the following criteria 1) turn-based, 2)
generally lengthy turns (&gt; 1 min), 3) free or abandonware. <br><h2>Feature List<br></h2><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Player list management -- </span>The
graphical interface allows you to easily create a player-list for your
game. The player-list can then be modified by all
players,&nbsp;allowing them to&nbsp;add, remove and modify&nbsp;players
mid-game (assuming the game itself supports this.)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Turn alerts and status updates -- </span>PlayMailer
runs discreetly in the background and alerts you when it is your turn
in a game. Status updates displayed in the PlayMailer window keep track
of whose turn it is, so you know who is being a slow coach!</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatically&nbsp;load, save and send games -- </span>Easily
launch games&nbsp;from within PlayMailer. PlayMailer will then
automatically import the save file into your game and load the save
game for you. When you are finished your turn, a single hot-key can be
used to automatically save the game and email it to the next player.
&nbsp; </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrated in-game chat -- </span>PlayMailer
allows you to send chat messages from within your game&nbsp;to
individual players, groups&nbsp;of players or to broadcast game wide
chat messages. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">All common email protocols and encryption methods supported -- </span>PlayMailer
supports the latest version of IMAP with Idle mode, as well as older
versions of IMAP and&nbsp;POP3. PlayMailer supports TLS, SSL and plain
text encryption. PlayMailer works with Gmail !</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unobtrusive mail server access -- </span>PlayMailer
will not download or delete any emails from your account except for
PlayMailer emails. So you can use your regular email account with
PlayMailer without worrying.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligent recovery -- </span>PlayMailer
responds intelligently to changes to the player list. For example, if
you delete the player who is currently having their turn. PlayMailer
will automatically roll-forward the game to the next player, so that the
game is not disrupted.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relay teams -- </span>PlayMailer
allows you to have multiple players on the same team. For example, you
could setup a game of chess with 2 white players and 2 black players.
The turns of the game would then alternate between the two teams as
follows; White Player&nbsp;1 goes first, then Black Player 1 then
White&nbsp;Player 2 then Black Player 2 then back to White Player 1.</li></ul> </body></html>
