here you can change settings specific to each game, such as a
game's&nbsp;folder path, or the command to run a game. Select a game
from the drop down list and change settings as needed. Most games will
have the following settings:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Folder Path --</span> Enter the path to the game's install folder. Use the [...] button on the right to browse to the folder.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Run Command --</span>
Enter a custom run command to launch the game. You should not need to
change this setting unless you have a specific reasonn. To change this
settings, first untick&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use default run command</span>
then change the run command. Note: By default&nbsp;many games are
configured&nbsp;to run the emulator&nbsp;DOSBox, however it is not
possible to change the run command to use a different emulator as
PlayMailer only supports DOSBox currently.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use default run command -- </span>if this is ticked then PlayMailer will automatically determine the game's run command based on the Game Folder Path.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run in full-screen -- </span>If ticked, PlayMailer will launch the game in full-screen, otherwise it will be launched in a normal window.</li></ul></body></html>
