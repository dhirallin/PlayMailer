a turn request to the&nbsp;player following you in the turn-order. This

or corrupted their session and needs to have the session information
re-sent to them.</li><li>The
game needs to be rolled back to an earlier turn. E.g. you can roll-back
the game to the player immediately following you in the turn-order,
regardless of whose turn it is<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: &nbsp;</span>This
